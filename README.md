# gateplugin-Format_JavaSerialization

This plugin adds support to load and write documents using the 
default Java serialization mechanism. In addition, the file can 
be optionally compressed with GZIP compression.

Uncompressed files have the extension "ser" and mime-type "application/javaserialization", compressed files have the extension "ser.gz" and mime-type 
"application/javaserializationgzip".
